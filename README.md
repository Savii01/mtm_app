# mtm_app

WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER***
1. work on the get request by Id
2. Make a unique Management and expense table for each artist, this is probably 
because i'm yet to understand how to use Axios GET request by id.
3. Work on the error status and messages, and also validation response to users on the application.

SHORT CUTS
1. In the course of this project i learnt about the use different modules
so basically, I used the react Material icons module in  the table structures design
